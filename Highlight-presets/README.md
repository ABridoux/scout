# Highlight presets

Those files are highlight colors presets for **Scout**. I tried to make them useful for some macOS terminal default styles.

To use a preset, download it and put it in the folder *~/.scout/*. Then change its name to *Colors.plist*. You can find more information about how to customise highlight colors [here](https://github.com/ABridoux/scout/wiki/%5B30%5D-Syntax-highlighting:-custom-colors).
